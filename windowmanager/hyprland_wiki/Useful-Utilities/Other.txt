Automatically Mounting Using

udiskie

Starting method:

manual (’exec-once')

USB mass storage devices, like thumb drives, mobile phones, digital cameras,
etc. are not mounted automatically to the file system.

Typically, they have to be manually mounted, often using root and

umount

to do so.

Many popular DEs automatically handle this by using

udisks2

wrappers.

udiskie

is a udisks2 front-end that allows to manage removable media such as
CDs or flash drives from userspace.

Install

udiskie

via your package manager, or

build manually

Head over to your

hyprland.conf

and add the following line:

exec-once

=

udiskie

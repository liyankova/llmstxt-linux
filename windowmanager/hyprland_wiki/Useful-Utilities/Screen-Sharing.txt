Screen sharing

Screensharing is done through PipeWire on Wayland.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have

pipewire

,

wireplumber

and

xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland

installed, enabled and running if you don’t have them yet.

Ensure that the

bitdepth

set in your configuration
matches that of your physical monitor.
See

Monitors

Screensharing

Read

this amazing gist by Bruno Ancona Sala

for a great tutorial.

XWayland

If your screensharing application is running under XWayland (like Discord or
Skype), it can only see other XWayland windows and cannot share an entire
screen or a Wayland window.

The KDE team has implemented a workaround for this called

xwaylandvideobridge

. You
can use

this AUR package

on Arch Linux. Note that Hyprland currently doesn’t support the way it tries to
hide the main window, so you will have to create some window rules to achieve
the same effect. See

this issue

for
more information. For example:

windowrule

=

opacity 0.0 override, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

windowrule

=

noanim, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

windowrule

=

noinitialfocus, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

windowrule

=

maxsize 1 1, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

windowrule

=

noblur, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

windowrule

=

nofocus, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

Hyprland on Other Distros

If you use Nix on distros other than NixOS, you can still use Hyprland.

The best option would be through

Home Manager

.

However, if Home Manager is not for you, Hyprland can be installed as a normal
package.

First,

enable flakes

, then, once you
have flakes working, install Hyprland through

nix profile

:

From Nixpkgs

From the Flake

The easiest method is to get Hyprland directly from Nixpkgs:

nix profile install nixpkgs#hyprland

Note

Make sure to enable

Cachix

first.

nix profile install github:hyprwm/Hyprland

Since you’re using Hyprland outside of NixOS, it won’t be able to find graphics
drivers.

To get around that, you can use

nixGL

.

First, install it:

nix profile install github:guibou/nixGL --impure

--impure

is needed due to

nixGL

’s reliance on hardware information.

From now on, you can run Hyprland by invoking it with nixGL.

nixGL Hyprland

Or by creating a wrapper script that runs the above command inside.

Upgrading

In order to upgrade all your packages, you can run:

nix profile upgrade

'.*'

Check the

nix profile

command documentation for other upgrade options.

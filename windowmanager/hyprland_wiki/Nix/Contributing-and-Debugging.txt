Contributing and Debugging

Everything needed to build and debug Hyprland and other hyprwm programs is
included inside the provided

devShell

s.

To use it in the cloned repo, simply run

nix develop

.

Build in debug mode

A debug build is already provided through

hyprland.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.hyprland-debug

.

Most hyprwm apps also provide their own

-debug

versions. For those that don’t,
one can build the debug version from the CLI by using

overrideAttrs

with

cmakeBuildType = "debug";

or

mesonBuildType = "debug";

, depending on the
program.

Bisecting an issue

Follow the

Bisecting an issue

guide. To build, run

nix build

.

Warning

To build with Tracy support, modify

nix/default.nix

to enable the flag, then run

nix build '.?submodules=1'

.

To view logs, pass the

--print-build-logs

(

-L

) flag.

To keep a failed build directory, pass the

--keep-failed

flag.

Building the Wayland stack with ASan

Run

nix develop

first, then follow the

Building with ASan

guide.

Getting a debug stacktrace

Debug stacktraces provide useful info on why a program crashed. To get proper
stacktraces from Hyprland, make sure it was

built in debug mode

.

After a crash, perform the following steps:

nix shell nixpkgs#gdb

# get gdb temporarily

coredumpctl

# check the PID of the recent crash

coredumpctl debug <PID>

# using the PID found in the previous step

The rest of the process is the same as

here

, from step 3 onwards.

Manual building

Nix works differently than other build systems, so it has its own abstractions
over popular build systems such as Meson, CMake and Ninja.

In order to manually build Hyprland, you can run the following commands, while
in the

nix develop

shell.

For CMake:

cmakeConfigurePhase

# to run the CMake configure phase

ninjaBuildPhase

# to run the Ninja build phase (or buildPhase when ninja is not available)

ninjaInstallPhase

# to run the Ninja install phase (or installPhase when ninja is not available)

For Meson:

mesonConfigurePhase

# to run the Meson configure phase

ninjaBuildPhase

# to run the Ninja build phase

mesonInstallPhase

# to run the Meson install phase

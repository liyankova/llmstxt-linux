Expanding functionality

Hyprland exposes two powerful sockets for you to use.

The first, socket1, can be fully controlled with

hyprctl

, see its usage

here

.

The second, socket2, sends events for certain changes / actions and can be used
to react to different events. See its description

here

.

Example script

This bash script will change the outer gaps to 20 if the currently focused
monitor is DP-1, and 30 otherwise.

#!/usr/bin/env bash

function

handle

{

if

[[

${

1

:

0

:

10

}

==

"focusedmon"

]]

;

then

if

[[

${

1

:

12

:

4

}

==

"DP-1"

]]

;

then

hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out

20

else

hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out

30

fi

fi

}

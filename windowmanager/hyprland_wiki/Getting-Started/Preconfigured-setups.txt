Preconfigured setups

Don’t want to spend days tinkering with Hyprland to get it just right from scratch, but you’d
rather start from a DE-like setting? You’ve found the right place.

Here are a few options to consider:

ML4W

ML4W or My Linux 4 Work, is a great DE-like experience out-of-the-box made by Stephan Raabe.

It includes simple gui settings apps, pre-configured feature-rich panels, a welcome app, and more.

JaKooLit

Another great option is installing JaKooLit’s dotfiles. They are another feature-rich and very well
maintained option.

JaKooLit provides installation scripts for many distros for their dotfiles, with
many themes to choose from.

Like material styling? Want a lot of great apps? Don’t mind a tiny bit of tinkering? end-4 has you covered.

HyDE

Prefer something more minimal, clean and aesthetic? Are you a terminal enjoyer?
HyDE dotfiles by HyDE Project are a very popular choice that will suit your needs.

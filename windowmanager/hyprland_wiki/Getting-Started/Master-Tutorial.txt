Master tutorial

If you are coming to Hyprland for the first time, this is the main tutorial to
read.

This tutorial covers everything you need to get things going. It links to other
pages where necessary.

Install Hyprland

See

Installation

and come back here once you have
successfully installed Hyprland.

Install

kitty

(default terminal emulator). This is available in most distros'
repositories.

Nvidia?

Note

If not using an Nvidia card, skip this step.

Please take a look at

The Nvidia page

before launching. It has
information regarding the needed environment and tweaks.

VM?

Note

If not using a VM, skip this step.

In a VM, make sure you have 3D acceleration enabled in your

virtio

config (or

virt-manager

) otherwise Hyprland

will not work

.

You can also passthru a GPU to make it work.

Please bear in mind 3D acceleration in VMs may be pretty slow.

Launching Hyprland

Hyprland can be executed by typing

Hyprland

in your tty.

If you are adventurous and on systemd, you can also try uwsm. Please note uwsm has some issues and for the majority of users, it’s recommended to use Hyprland without it.
Uwsm provides additional features such as

xdg-autostart

support, launching any application as a systemd-unit with

uwsm app

helper, and the ability to enable services for programs that rely on a graphical session and provide such services (e.g waybar). See

uwsm

page for further instructions.

Warning

Do

not

launch Hyprland with

root

permissions (don’t

sudo

)

You can see some launch flags by doing

Hyprland -h

, these include setting the
config path, ignoring a check for the above, etc.

Login managers are not officially supported, but here’s a short compatibility
list:

SDDM → Works flawlessly. Install sddm ⩾ 0.20.0 or the

latest git version

(or

sddm-git

from AUR) to prevent
SDDM bug

1476

(90s shutdowns).

GDM → Works with the caveat of crashing Hyprland on the first launch.

greetd → Works flawlessly, especially with

ReGreet

.

ly → Works flawlessly.

DE-like pre-configured setups

Do you want to just get Hyprland pre-configured like a DE,
without making your own configuration from scratch?

Check out the

Preconfigured setups page

to see a few options.

These dotfiles should do everything for you, and have their own tutorials as well.

If you choose to use those, you can skip the next step. However, it’s still recommended to read all the points below
it. They’ll give you recommended apps, replacements for old X11 software, information about configuring displays,
etc.

In Hyprland with the default config

You’re good to go with your adventure, technically.

Use

SUPER

+

Q

to launch kitty. If you wish to choose the
default terminal before you proceed, you can do so in

~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf

(

example config

).

If you want the best experience with less hassle googling, keep reading.

Critical software

See the

Must-have Software page

for the
crucial things to make Wayland / Hyprland / other apps work correctly.

Monitors config

See

Configuring Hyprland page

to learn all about
configuring your displays.

Apps / X11 replacements

See the

Useful Utilities page

and the

Sway wiki page

about that. You can also visit the

Awesome-Hyprland

repository for a more comprehensive list.

Fully configure Hyprland

Head onto the

Configuring Hyprland page

to learn all
about configuring Hyprland to your liking.

Cursors

Cursors are a notorious pain to set up when you don’t know how. See

this FAQ entry on changing your mouse cursor

If your cursor does not appear, see

this FAQ entry on cursor not rendering

Themes

Since Hyprland is not a fully-fledged Desktop Environment, you will need to use
tools such as

lxappearance

or

nwg-look

(recommended) for GTK, and

hyprqt6engine

for qt6 apps.

Force apps to use Wayland

A lot of apps will use Wayland by default. Chromium (and other browsers based on
it, or Electron) don’t. You need to pass

--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland

to them or use

.conf

files where possible. Chromium-based browsers also should have a toggle
in

chrome://flags

. Search for

“ozone”

and select Wayland. If you are on
NixOS you can also set the environment variable

NIXOS_OZONE_WL=1

in your
configuration.

For most electron apps, you should put the above in

~/.config/electron-flags.conf

. Note that VSCode is known

not

to work with
it.

A few more environment variables for forcing Wayland mode are documented

here

.

You can check whether an app is running in xwayland or not with

hyprctl clients

.

# Client React DOM APIs – React

[API Reference](/reference/react)

# Client React DOM APIs

The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). These APIs are typically used at the top level of your app to initialize your React tree. A [framework](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.

## Client APIs

* [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
* [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by [`react-dom/server`.](/reference/react-dom/server)

## Browser support

React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above. Some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10.

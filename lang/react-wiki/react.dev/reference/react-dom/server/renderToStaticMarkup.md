## Reference

### `renderToStaticMarkup(reactNode, options?)`

On the server, call `renderToStaticMarkup` to render your app to HTML.

```
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';

const html = renderToStaticMarkup(<Page />);
```

It will produce non-interactive HTML output of your React components.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters

* `reactNode`: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX node like `<Page />`.
* **optional** `options`: An object for server render.
  + **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.

#### Returns

An HTML string.

#### Caveats

* `renderToStaticMarkup` output cannot be hydrated.
* `renderToStaticMarkup` has limited Suspense support. If a component suspends, `renderToStaticMarkup` immediately sends its fallback as HTML.
* `renderToStaticMarkup` works in the browser, but using it in the client code is not recommended. If you need to render a component to HTML in the browser, [get the HTML by rendering it into a DOM node.](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString#removing-rendertostring-from-the-client-code)

## Usage

### Rendering a non-interactive React tree as HTML to a string

Call `renderToStaticMarkup` to render your app to an HTML string which you can send with your server response:

```
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';

// The route handler syntax depends on your backend framework

app.use('/', (request, response) => {

const html = renderToStaticMarkup(<Page />);

response.send(html);

});
```

This will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components.

### Pitfall

This method renders **non-interactive HTML that cannot be hydrated.** This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, or if you’re rendering completely static content like emails.

Interactive apps should use [`renderToString`](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString) on the server and [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) on the client.

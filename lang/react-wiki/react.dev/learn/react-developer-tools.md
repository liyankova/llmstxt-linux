# React Developer Tools – React

[Learn React](/learn)

[Setup](/learn/setup)

# React Developer Tools

Use React Developer Tools to inspect React [components](/learn/your-first-component), edit [props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) and [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), and identify performance problems.

### You will learn

* How to install React Developer Tools

## Browser extension

The easiest way to debug websites built with React is to install the React Developer Tools browser extension. It is available for several popular browsers:

* [Install for **Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
* [Install for **Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
* [Install for **Edge**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil)

Now, if you visit a website **built with React,** you will see the *Components* and *Profiler* panels.

### Safari and other browsers

For other browsers (for example, Safari), install the [`react-devtools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools) npm package:

```
# Yarn

yarn global add react-devtools

# Npm

npm install -g react-devtools
```

Next open the developer tools from the terminal:

```
react-devtools
```

Then connect your website by adding the following `<script>` tag to the beginning of your website’s `<head>`:

```
<html>

<head>

<script src="http://localhost:8097"></script>
```

Reload your website in the browser now to view it in developer tools.

## Mobile (React Native)

To inspect apps built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), you can use [React Native DevTools](https://reactnative.dev/docs/react-native-devtools), the built-in debugger that deeply integrates React Developer Tools. All features work identically to the browser extension, including native element highlighting and selection.

> For versions of React Native earlier than 0.76, please use the standalone build of React DevTools by following the [Safari and other browsers](#safari-and-other-browsers) guide above.

# Catalyst - Tailwind CSS Application UI Kit

> I love Catalyst because I can gradually make it my own while using the stock defaults to quickly get something on the page. I also love that it lets me see how the creators of Tailwind CSS structure their components, so I (or my AI agents) can emulate their best practices.

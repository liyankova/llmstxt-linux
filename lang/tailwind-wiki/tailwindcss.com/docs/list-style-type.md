# list-style-type

Utilities for controlling the marker style of a list.

| Class | Styles |
| --- | --- |
| `list-disc` | `list-style-type: disc;` |
| `list-decimal` | `list-style-type: decimal;` |
| `list-none` | `list-style-type: none;` |
| `list-(<custom-property>)` | `list-style-type: var(<custom-property>);` |
| `list-[<value>]` | `list-style-type: <value>;` |

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic example](#basic-example)

Use utilities like `list-disc` and `list-decimal` to control the style of the markers in a list:

list-disc

* Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down
* And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
* I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

list-decimal

* Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down
* And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
* I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

list-none

* Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down
* And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
* I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

```
<ul class="list-disc">  <li>Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down</li>  <!-- ... --></ul><ol class="list-decimal">  <li>Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down</li>  <!-- ... --></ol><ul class="list-none">  <li>Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down</li>  <!-- ... --></ul>
```

### [Using a custom value](#using-a-custom-value)

Use the `list-[<value>]` syntax to set the marker based on a completely custom value:

```
<ol class="list-[upper-roman] ...">  <!-- ... --></ol>
```

For CSS variables, you can also use the `list-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

```
<ol class="list-(--my-marker) ...">  <!-- ... --></ol>
```

This is just a shorthand for `list-[var(<custom-property>)]` that adds the `var()` function for you automatically.

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `list-style-type` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
<ul class="list-none md:list-disc ...">  <!-- ... --></ul>
```

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).

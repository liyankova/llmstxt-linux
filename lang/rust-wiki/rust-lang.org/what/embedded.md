# Embedded devices - Rust Programming Language

![A microscope](/static/images/microscope.svg)

### Powerful static analysis

Enforce pin and peripheral configuration at compile time. Guarantee that resources won’t be used by unintended parts of your application.

### Flexible memory

Dynamic memory allocation is optional. Use a global allocator and dynamic data structures. Or leave out the heap altogether and statically allocate everything.

### Fearless concurrency

Rust makes it impossible to accidentally share state between threads. Use any concurrency approach you like, and you’ll still get Rust’s strong guarantees.

### Interoperability

Integrate Rust into your existing C codebase or leverage an existing SDK to write a Rust application.

### Portability

Write a library or driver once, and use it with a variety of systems, ranging from very small microcontrollers to powerful SBCs.

### Community driven

As part of the Rust open source project, support for embedded systems is driven by a best-in-class open source community, with support from commercial partners.

“I was so excited when I came across Rust, from Mozilla. Rust is a new programming language, with the tag line ‘safe, fast, concurrent – pick three.’ It also has an assured future, with a powerful, committed user community.”

– Jonathan Pallant, Senior Consultant, Cambridge Consultants

> At Sensirion we recently used Rust to create an embedded demonstrator for Sensirion’s [Particulate Matter Sensor](https://sensirion-automotive.com/products#PM2_5). Due to the easy cross-compilation and the availability of many high quality crates on crates.io **we quickly ended up with a fast and robust demonstrator.**

– Raphael Nestler, Software Engineer, Sensirion

> At Airborne Engineering Ltd. we recently used Rust to write an Ethernet bootloader, [blethrs](https://github.com/airborneengineering/blethrs), for our in-house data acquisition system. **Rust is a promising language and we’re excited to use it for our future projects, embedded and otherwise.**

– Dr. Adam Greig, Instrumentation Engineer, Airborne Engineering Ltd.

> [Rust] enables us to ship software faster and more correct than we thought possible. Thanks to Rust, we can take memory safety for granted, while other benefits of a zero-overhead language with a sophisticated type system help us develop maintainable software. **Rust makes our customers happy, as well as our engineers.**

– Marc Brinkmann, CEO, 49nord

> **We think it’s really cool that we can use a modern nice language in the embedded space** where usually there’s no alternative to C/C++

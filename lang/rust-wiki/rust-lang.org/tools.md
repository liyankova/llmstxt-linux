# Tools - Rust Programming Language

Whether you prefer working with code from the
command line, or using rich graphical editors, there’s a Rust
integration available for your editor of choice. Or you can build your
own using [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer).

Cargo is the build tool for Rust. It bundles all
common actions into a single command. No boilerplate required.

### Install

With tens of thousands of packages, there’s a
good chance [crates.io](https://crates.io) has the solution
you’re looking for. Stand on the shoulders of giants, and move your team
from repetition to innovation.

### Test

Bring confidence to your code through Rust’s
excellent testing tools. `cargo test` is
Rust’s unified solution to testing. Write tests next to your code, or in
separate files: it provides a solution for all testing needs.

### Deploy

`cargo build` creates
lean binaries for every platform. With a single command your code can
target Windows, Linux, macOS, and the web. All part of a modern interface,
with no need for bespoke build files.

Rust’s industry-grade tools make collaboration
fearless, allowing teams to focus on the tasks that matter.

### Rustfmt

Rustfmt automatically formats Rust code,
making it easier to read, write, and maintain. And most importantly:
never debate spacing or brace position ever again.

### Clippy

*“It looks like you’re writing an
Iterator.”*   
 Clippy helps developers of all experience levels
write idiomatic code, and enforce standards.

[Go to repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)

### Cargo Doc

Cargo’s doc builder makes it so no API
ever goes undocumented. It’s available locally through
`cargo doc`, and online for public crates
through [docs.rs](https://docs.rs).

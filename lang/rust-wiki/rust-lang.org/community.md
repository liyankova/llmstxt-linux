### Find a local meetup or conference

There are more than 90 Meetups and several conferences worldwide in over 35 countries. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User Groups. They are a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetings are usually informal and open to everyone.

# Rust Programming Language

### Performance

Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or
garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on
embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

### Reliability

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety
and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of
bugs at compile-time.

### Productivity

Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error
messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager
and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and
type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

In 2018, the Rust community decided to improve the programming experience
for a few distinct domains (see [the 2018
roadmap](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html)). For these, you can find many high-quality crates and some
awesome guides on how to get started.

### Command Line

Whip up a CLI tool quickly with Rust’s robust ecosystem.
Rust helps you maintain your app with confidence and distribute it with ease.

### WebAssembly

Use Rust to supercharge your JavaScript, one module at a time.
Publish to npm, bundle with webpack, and you’re off to the races.

### Networking

Predictable performance. Tiny resource footprint. Rock-solid reliability.
Rust is great for network services.

### Embedded

Targeting low-resource devices?
Need low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences?
Rust has you covered.

[Starting With Embedded](/what/embedded)

Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production
today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. **From startups to large
corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.**

### Read Rust

We love documentation! Take a look at the books available online, as well as key blog posts and user guides.

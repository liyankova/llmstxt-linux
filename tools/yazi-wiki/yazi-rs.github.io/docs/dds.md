# DDS | Yazi

* DDS
Version: 25.5.31

On this page

DDS (Data Distribution Service) is designed to achieve communication and state synchronization between multiple Yazi instances, as well as state persistence. It is built on a client-server architecture but does not require running additional server processes.

It deeply integrates with a publish-subscribe model based on the Lua API.

## Concept[​](#concept "Direct link to Concept")

* Local: the current instance, that is, the current Yazi process.
* Remote: instances other than the current instance.
* Static message: A message with a kind that starts with `@` will be persistently stored and automatically restored when a new instance starts. To un-persist, send `nil` to that kind.

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

The DDS has three usage:

* [Plugin API](/docs/plugins/utils#ps): Using Lua-based publish-subscribe model as the message carrier.
* [`ya pub` and `ya pub-to`](#ya-pub): Using [`ya` CLI tool](/docs/cli) as the message carrier.
* [`ya emit` and `ya emit-to`](#ya-emit): Using [`ya` CLI tool](/docs/cli) as the command carrier.
* [Real-time `stdout` reporting](#stdout-reporting): Using `stdout` as the carrier.

### `ya pub` and `ya pub-to`[​](#ya-pub "Direct link to ya-pub")

If you're in a Yazi subshell where the `$YAZI_ID` environment variable is set, you can send a message to the current instance using `ya pub`.
It requires a `kind` argument, which is consistent with [`ps.pub()`](/docs/plugins/utils#ps.pub):

```
ya pub <kind> --str "string body"  
ya pub <kind> --list "a" "b" "c"  
ya pub <kind> --json '{"key":"json body"}'  
  
# For example, request the current instance to extract `a.zip` and `b.7z`  
ya pub extract --list "/root/a.zip" "/root/b.7z"
```

You can also send a message to a specified remote instance(s) using `ya pub-to`, with the required `receiver` and `kind` arguments, consistent with [`ps.pub_to()`](/docs/plugins/utils#ps.pub_to):

```
ya pub-to <receiver> <kind> --str "string body"  
ya pub-to <receiver> <kind> --list "a" "b" "c"  
ya pub-to <receiver> <kind> --json '{"key":"json body"}'  
  
# If you're in a Yazi subshell,  
# you can obtain the ID of the current instance through `$YAZI_ID`.  
ya pub-to "$YAZI_ID" my-event --str "Hello world!"  
  
# If you are not in a Yazi subshell, i.e., communicating with Yazi externally,  
# you can start with `yazi --client-id <globally-unique-id>`, and pass that ID to `ya pub-to`.  
MY_UNIQUE_ID="$(date +%s)$RANDOM"  
yazi --client-id "$MY_UNIQUE_ID"  
ya pub-to "$MY_UNIQUE_ID" my-event --str "Hello world!"
```

For greater convenience in integrating within the command-line environment, they support two body formats:

* String: a straightforward format, suitable for most scenarios, without the need for additional tools for encoding
* List: An array of strings, it is useful for carrying a file list to the message, through `$@` in your shell
* JSON: for advanced needs, support for types and more complex data can be represented through the JSON format

### `ya emit` and `ya emit-to`[​](#ya-emit "Direct link to ya-emit")

If you're in a Yazi subshell where the `$YAZI_ID` environment variable is set, you can use `ya emit` to send a command to the current instance for execution.

The command format is the same as what you'd write in the [`keymap.toml`](/docs/configuration/keymap):

```
ya emit <command> <args>
```

For example:

```
ya emit cd /tmp  
ya emit reveal /tmp/foo
```

You can also send commands to a specific remote instance using `ya emit-to`:

```
ya emit-to <receiver> <command> <args>
```

For example:

```
ya emit-to "$YAZI_ID" cd /tmp
```

### Real-time `stdout` reporting[​](#stdout-reporting "Direct link to stdout-reporting")

You can specify the `--local-events` and `--remote-events` options when starting Yazi:

```
# Local events  
yazi --local-events=kind1,kind2  
# Remote events  
yazi --remote-events=kind1,kind2  
# Both local and remote events  
yazi --local-events=kind1,kind2 --remote-events=kind1,kind2
```

When an event of the specified kind is received, it will be output to `stdout`:

```
hover,0,200,{"tab":0,"url":"/root/Downloads"}  
cd,0,100,{"tab":0,"url":"/root/Downloads"}
```

One payload per line, each payload contains the following fields separated by commas:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| kind | The kind of the message |
| receiver | The remote instance ID that receives the message; if it's `0`, broadcasts to all remote instances |
| sender | The sender of the message |
| body | The body of the message, which is a JSON string |

This provides the ability to report Yazi's internal events in real-time, which is useful for external tool integration (such as Neovim), as they will be able to subscribe to the events triggered by the user behavior.

## Builtin plugins[​](#plugins "Direct link to Builtin plugins")

### `dds.lua`[​](#dds.lua "Direct link to dds.lua")

This plugin provides a `dds-emit` event kind, which is used for the implementation of the `ya emit` subcommand — `ya emit` is a shorthand for `ya pub`, and the emitted command will be converted into an equivalent `ya pub` event message.

With `ya emit`, you can implement many interesting features, such as synchronizing the CWD of the current Yazi instance when exiting from a subshell:

* Zsh
* Fish
* Nushell

```
# Change Yazi's CWD to PWD on subshell exit  
if [[ -n "$YAZI_ID" ]]; then  
	function _yazi_cd() {  
		ya emit cd "$PWD"  
	}  
	add-zsh-hook zshexit _yazi_cd  
fi
```

### `session.lua`[​](#session.lua "Direct link to session.lua")

This plugin provides cross-instance yank ability, which means you can yank files in one instance, and then paste them in another instance.

To enable it, add these lines to your `init.lua`, then restart **all** Yazi instances to apply the changes:

```
require("session"):setup {  
	sync_yanked = true,  
}
```

### `extract.lua`[​](#extract.lua "Direct link to extract.lua")

This plugin provides an `extract` event kind for archive extraction, which accepts an array of file URL. You can bind it as [the opener](/docs/configuration/yazi#opener) for archives:

```
# ~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml  
[opener]  
extract = [  
	{ run = 'ya pub extract --list "$@"', desc = "Extract here", for = "unix" },  
	{ run = 'ya pub extract --list %*',   desc = "Extract here", for = "windows" },  
]
```

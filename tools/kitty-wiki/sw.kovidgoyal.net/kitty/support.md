# Support kitty development ❤️ - kitty

# Support kitty development ❤️[¶](#support-kitty-development "Link to this heading")

My goal with *kitty* is to move the stagnant terminal ecosystem forward. To that
end kitty has many foundational features, such as: [image support](../graphics-protocol/), [superlative performance](../performance/),
[various enhancements to the terminal protocol](../protocol-extensions/),
etc. These features allow the development of rich terminal applications, such
as [Side-by-side diff](../kittens/diff/) and [Unicode input](../kittens/unicode_input/).

If you wish to support this mission and see the terminal ecosystem evolve,
consider donating so that I can devote more time to *kitty* development.
I have personally written [almost all kitty code](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/graphs/contributors).

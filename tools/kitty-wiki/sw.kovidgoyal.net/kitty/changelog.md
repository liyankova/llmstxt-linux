# Changelog - kitty

# Changelog[¶](#changelog "Link to this heading")

*kitty* is a feature-rich, cross-platform, *fast*, GPU based terminal.
To update *kitty*, [follow the instructions](../binary/).

## Recent major new features[¶](#recent-major-new-features "Link to this heading")

### Sessions [0.43][¶](#sessions-0-43 "Link to this heading")

kitty has long had support for [Sessions](../sessions/), aka simple text files where you
can define what tabs, windows and programs you wish to run in kitty. Now in
addition to that kitty has the ability to [create and switch between
sessions](../sessions/#goto-session) with a single keypress and also to manually setup some
tabs/windows in kitty and [save it as a session file](../sessions/#complex-sessions),
for seamless and intuitive session file creation.

### A scrollbar for the kitty scrollback [0.43][¶](#a-scrollbar-for-the-kitty-scrollback-0-43 "Link to this heading")

A long requested feature, kitty has finally [gotten a scrollbar](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/8945)
that can be used with the mouse for browsing its scrollback. The bar appear
automatically when you start scrolling backwards and is [`extensively
configurable`](../conf/#opt-kitty.scrollbar) in kitty.conf. Note that the old `scrollback_indicator_opacity`
option is deprecated.

### Multiple cursors [0.43][¶](#multiple-cursors-0-43 "Link to this heading")

kitty has pioneered a new [escape code protocol](../multiple-cursors-protocol/) that allows terminal applications to use multiple
cursors, rendered natively. These are typically used in editors to make the
same edit at multiple locations. Now terminal based editors can use properly
rendered native cursors, just like their GUI cousins, at last.

### Access kitty with a single keypress [0.42][¶](#access-kitty-with-a-single-keypress-0-42 "Link to this heading")

kitty now has a Quake like floating, translucent terminal window, so you can access
all that kitty goodness instantly with a single keypress.

See the screenshots on the side and head over to the [kitten page for details
on how to set it up](../kittens/quick-access-terminal/).

### Multiple sized text [0.40][¶](#multiple-sized-text-0-40 "Link to this heading")

kitty is the first major terminal to introduce the concept of multiple sized
text. Terminal programs running in kitty can now opt-in to use and display text
in multiple font sizes both larger and smaller than the base font size. This is
done in a backwards compatible, opt-in way that does not affect how traditional
terminal programs work at all. For details on the new feature and how to use
it, see [The text sizing protocol](../text-sizing-protocol/).

### Cursor trails [0.37][¶](#cursor-trails-0-37 "Link to this heading")

Show an animated trail when the text cursor makes large jumps making it easy
to follow cursor movements. Inspired by the similar feature in neovide, but
works with terminal multiplexers and kitty windows as well. See [the pull
request](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/7970) for a demonstration video. This feature is optional and must be
turned on by the [`cursor_trail`](../conf/#opt-kitty.cursor_trail) option in `kitty.conf`.

### Variable font support [0.36][¶](#variable-font-support-0-36 "Link to this heading")

Terminal aficionados spend all day staring at text, so getting text
rendering just right is very important. In that spirit, kitty now supports
[OpenType Variable fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_font).
These allow precise customisation of font characteristics, such as weight and
spacing. Not only that, kitty now has a new [choose-fonts](../kittens/choose-fonts/) kitten that provides a UI for choosing fonts with
support for font features, variable fonts and previews of how the font will
look. This is in addition to its existing best-in-class font customization
abilities, such as: [`symbol_map`](../conf/#opt-kitty.symbol_map), [`text_composition_strategy`](../conf/#opt-kitty.text_composition_strategy),
[`font_features`](../conf/#opt-kitty.font_features) and [`modify_font`](../conf/#opt-kitty.modify_font). kitty knows text rendering is
important, and goes the extra mile for it.

### Desktop notifications [0.36][¶](#desktop-notifications-0-36 "Link to this heading")

*kitty* now has a [notify](../kittens/notify/) kitten that can be used to
display desktop notifications from the command line, even over SSH. It has
support for icons, buttons, updating notifications, waiting till
the notification is closed, etc. The underlying [Desktop notifications](../desktop-notifications/)
protocol has been expanded to support all these features.

### Wayland goodies [0.34][¶](#wayland-goodies-0-34 "Link to this heading")

Wayland users should rejoice as kitty now comes with major Wayland
quality-of-life improvements:

* Draw GPU accelerated [desktop panels and background](../kittens/panel/)
  running arbitrary terminal programs. For example, run [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/) as your desktop background
* Background blur for transparent windows is now supported under KDE
  using a custom KDE specific protocol
* The kitty window decorations in GNOME are now fully functional with buttons
  and they follow system dark/light mode automatically
* kitty now supports fractional scaling in Wayland which means pixel perfect
  rendering when you use a fractional scale with no wasted performance on
  resizing an overdrawn pixmap in the compositor

With this release kitty’s Wayland support is now on par with X11, provided
you use a decent Wayland compositor.

### Cheetah speed 🐆 [0.33][¶](#cheetah-speed-0-33 "Link to this heading")

kitty has grown up and become a cheetah. It now parses data it receives in
parallel [using SIMD vector CPU instructions](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/7005) for a 2x speedup in
benchmarks and a 10%-50% real world speedup depending on workload. There is a
new benchmarking kitten `kitten __benchmark__` that can be used to measure
terminal throughput. There is also [a table](../performance/#throughput) showing kitty is
much faster than other terminal emulators based on the benchmark kitten. While
kitty was already so fast that its performance was never a bottleneck, this
improvement makes it even faster and more importantly reduces the energy
consumption to do the same tasks.

* Session files: Add a new `focus_tab` command to specify which tab should be
  active when a session is loaded. Accepts either a plain number (0-based index)
  or a match expression for flexible tab selection, allowing sessions to preserve
  the active tab state ([Sessions](../sessions/))
* [`save_as_session`](../actions/#action-save_as_session): Add `--base-dir` option to specify a base directory

  switching of dark/light mode when setting [`macos_titlebar_color`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_titlebar_color) to an
  arbitrary color ([#9034](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/9034))
* [`goto_session`](../actions/#action-goto_session): Add `--sort-by=alphabetical` to have the interactive session
  picker list the sessions in a fixed order rather than by most recent
  ([#9033](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/9033))

  --program`](../kittens/hints/#cmdoption-kitty-kitten-hints-program) option work when using the `self`

  used by full screen terminal programs and even games, see
  [Comprehensive keyboard handling in terminals](../keyboard-protocol/) ([#3248](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3248))
* **Backward incompatibility**: Session files now use the full [launch](../launch/)
  command with all its capabilities. However, the syntax of the command is
  slightly different from before. In particular watchers are now specified
  directly on launch and environment variables are set using `--env`.
* Allow setting colors when creating windows using the [launch](../launch/) command.
* A new option [`tab_powerline_style`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_powerline_style) to control the appearance of the tab

  acknowledgement and decided to use incompatible escape codes for.
* Add entries to the terminfo file for some user capabilities that are shared
  with XTerm ([#3193](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/3193))
* The launch command now does more sophisticated resolving of executables to
  run. The system-wide PATH is used first, then system specific default paths,
  and finally the PATH inside the shell.
* Double clicking on empty tab bar area now opens a new tab ([#3201](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3201))

  the key matches an English key, send that to the program running in the
  terminal automatically ([#2000](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/2000))
* When matching shortcuts, also match on shifted keys, so a shortcut defined as

  some reason puts empty glyphs after the ligature glyph rather than before it
  ([#3313](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3313))
* Improve handling of infinite length ligatures in newer versions of FiraCode
  and CascadiaCode. Now such ligatures are detected based on glyph naming
  convention. This removes the gap in the ligatures at cell boundaries ([#2695](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/2695))

  a bug in the 0.12.0 macOS package

### 0.12.0 [2018-09-01][¶](#id97 "Link to this heading")

* Preserve the mouse selection even when the contents of the screen are
  scrolled or overwritten provided the new text does not intersect the
  selected lines.
* Linux: Implement support for Input Method Extensions (multilingual input
  using standard keyboards) via [IBus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus/wiki/ReadMe) ([#469](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/469))
* Implement completion for the kitty command in bash and zsh. See
  [Shell integration](../shell-integration/#shell-integration).
* Render the text under the cursor in a fixed color, configurable via
  the option [`cursor_text_color`](../conf/#opt-kitty.cursor_text_color) ([#126](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/126))
* Add an option [`env`](../conf/#opt-kitty.env) to set environment variables in child processes
  from kitty.conf
* Add an action to the `clear_terminal` function to scroll the screen
  contents into the scrollback buffer ([#1113](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1113))
* Implement high precision scrolling with the trackpad on platforms such as
  macOS and Wayland that implement it. ([#819](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/819))
* macOS: Allow scrolling window contents using mouse wheel/trackpad even when the
  window is not the active window ([#729](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/729))
* Remote control: Allow changing the current window layout with a new
  [kitten @ goto-layout](../remote-control/#at-goto-layout) command ([#845](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/845))
* Remote control: Allow matching windows by the environment variables of their
  child process as well
* Allow running kittens via the remote control system ([#738](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/738))
* Allow enabling remote control in only some kitty windows
* Add a keyboard shortcut to reset the terminal ([`ctrl+shift+delete`](../conf/#shortcut-kitty.Reset-the-terminal)). It
  takes parameters so you can define your own shortcuts to clear the
  screen/scrollback also ([#747](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/747))
* Fix one-pixel line appearing at window edges at some window sizes when
  displaying images with background opacity enabled ([#741](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/741))
* diff kitten: Fix error when right hand side file is binary and left hand side
  file is text ([#752](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/752))

  to create top-level OS windows ([#770](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/770))
* macOS: The [`focus_follows_mouse`](../conf/#opt-kitty.focus_follows_mouse) option now also works across top-level kitty OS windows
  ([#754](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/754))
* Fix detection of URLs in HTML source code (URLs inside quotes) ([#785](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/785))
* Implement support for emoji skin tone modifiers ([#787](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/787))
* Round-trip the zwj unicode character. Rendering of sequences containing zwj
  is still not implemented, since it can cause the collapse of an unbounded
  number of characters into a single cell. However, kitty at least preserves
  the zwj by storing it as a combining character.
* macOS: Disable the custom mouse cursor. Using a custom cursor fails on dual
  GPU machines. I give up, Apple users will just have to live with the
  limitations of their choice of OS. ([#794](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/794))
* macOS: Fix control+tab key combination not working ([#801](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/801))

### 0.11.3 [2018-07-10][¶](#id98 "Link to this heading")

* Draw only the minimum borders needed for inactive windows. That is only the borders
  that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note that setting
  a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all borders to be drawn.
  The old behavior of drawing all borders can be restored via the
  [`draw_minimal_borders`](../conf/#opt-kitty.draw_minimal_borders) setting in kitty.conf. ([#699](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/699))
* macOS: Add an option [`macos_window_resizable`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_window_resizable) to control if kitty
  top-level windows are resizable using the mouse or not ([#698](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/698))

  titlebar hidden causing window resizing to not work. ([#711](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/711))
* Fix triple-click to select line not working when the entire line is filled
  ([#703](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/703))
* When dragging to select with the mouse “grab” the mouse so that if it strays
  into neighboring windows, the selection is still updated ([#624](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/624))
* When clicking in the margin/border area of a window, map the click to the
  nearest cell in the window. Avoids selection with the mouse failing when
  starting the selection just outside the window.
* When drag-scrolling stop the scroll when the mouse button is released.
* Fix a regression in the previous release that caused pasting large amounts
  of text to be duplicated ([#709](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/709))

* Add an option [`single_window_margin_width`](../conf/#opt-kitty.single_window_margin_width) to allow different margins
  when only a single window is visible in the layout ([#688](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/688))
* Add a [`kitty --hold`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-hold) command line option to stay open after the child process exits ([#667](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/667))
* diff kitten: When triggering a search scroll to the first match automatically
* [`kitty --debug-font-fallback`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-debug-font-fallback) also prints out what basic fonts were matched
* When closing a kitty window reset the mouse cursor to its default shape and ensure it is visible ([#655](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/655)).

* Linux installer: Fix installer failing on systems with python < 3.5
* Support “-T” as an alias for “--title” ([#659](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/659))
* Fix a regression in the previous release that broke using
  `--debug-config` with custom key mappings ([#695](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/695))

### 0.11.1 [2018-06-17][¶](#id100 "Link to this heading")

  to make [`kitty --single-instance`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-single-instance) wait for the closing of the newly opened
  window before quitting ([#630](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/630))
* diff kitten: Allow theming the selection background/foreground as well
* diff kitten: Display CRLF line endings using the unicode return symbol
  instead of <d> as it is less intrusive ([#638](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/638))
* diff kitten: Fix default foreground/background colors not being restored when
  kitten quits ([#637](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/637))
* Fix [`kitten @ set-colors --all`](../remote-control/#cmdoption-kitten-set-colors-all) not working when more than one window
  present ([#632](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/632))
* Fix a regression that broke the legacy increase/decrease\_font\_size actions
* Clear scrollback on reset ([#631](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/631))

  See [`tab_bar_style`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_bar_style) and [`tab_fade`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_fade) for details. The old look can be
  restored by setting [`tab_bar_style`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_bar_style) to `separator`.
* [Pre-compiled binaries](../binary/) with all bundled dependencies for Linux
  ([#595](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/595))
* A [new kitten](../kittens/panel/) to create dock panels on X11 desktops
  showing the output from arbitrary terminal programs.
* Reduce data sent to the GPU per render by 30% ([commit: 8dea5b3e3](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/commit/8dea5b3e3ec1db8597f3a3649b5cefd52f41e409))
* Implement changing the font size for individual top level (OS) windows
  ([#408](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/408))
* When viewing the scrollback in less using [`ctrl+shift+h`](../conf/#shortcut-kitty.Browse-scrollback-buffer-in-pager) and kitty
  is currently scrolled, position the scrollback in less to match kitty’s
  scroll position. ([#148](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/148))

  working if no kitty window currently has focus. ([#524](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/524))
* macOS: Keep kitty running even when the last window is closed. This is in
  line with how applications are supposed to behave on macOS ([#543](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/543)).
  There is a new option ([`macos_quit_when_last_window_closed`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_quit_when_last_window_closed)) to control
  this.
* macOS: Add macOS standard shortcuts for copy, paste and new OS window
  (⌘+C, ⌘+V, ⌘+N)

  ([#581](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/581))
* Linux: When using layouts that map the keys to non-ascii characters,
  map shortcuts using the ascii equivalents, from the default layout.
  ([#606](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/606))
* Linux: Fix fonts not being correctly read from TrueType Collection
  (.ttc) files ([#577](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/577))

  By default only writing is allowed. This feature is supported in many
  terminals, search for OSC 52 clipboard to find out more about using it.
* Fix moving cursor outside a defined page area incorrectly causing the cursor
  to be placed inside the page area. Caused incorrect rendering in neovim, in
  some situations ([#542](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/542)).
* Render a couple more powerline symbols directly, bypassing the font
  ([#550](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/550)).
* Fix ctrl+alt+<special> not working in normal and application keyboard ([#548](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/548)).
* Partial fix for rendering Right-to-left languages like Arabic. Rendering of
  Arabic is never going to be perfect, but now it is at least readable.
* Fix Ctrl+backspace acting as plain backspace in normal and application
  keyboard modes ([#538](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/538)).

  inactive\_border\_color.
* macOS: Add support for dead keys
* Unicode input: When searching by name search for prefix matches as well as
  whole word matches
* Dynamically allocate the memory used for the scrollback history buffer.

  buffer not working correctly if kitty is itself scrolled up.
* Fix window focus gained/lost events not being reported to child programs when
  switching windows/tabs using the various keyboard shortcuts.
* Fix tab title not changing to reflect the window title when switching between different windows in a tab
* Ignore -e if it is specified on the command line. This is for compatibility
  with broken software that assumes terminals should run with an -e option to
  execute commands instead of just passing the commands as arguments.

  inside kitty and extend its capabilities. Examples include unicode input and
  selecting URLs with the keyboard.
* Input arbitrary unicode characters by pressing Ctrl+Shift+u. You can choose
  characters by name, by hex code, by recently used, etc. There is even and
  editable Favorites list.
* Open URLs using only the keyboard. kitty has a new “hints mode”. Press
  Ctrl+Shift+e and all detected URLs on the screen are highlighted with a key
  to press to open them. The facility is customizable so you can change
  what is detected as a URL and which program is used to open it.
* Add an option to change the titlebar color of kitty windows on macOS
* Only consider Emoji characters with default Emoji presentation to be two
  cells wide. This matches the standard. Also add support for the Unicode Emoji
  variation presentation selector.
* Prevent video tearing during high speed scrolling by syncing draws
  to the monitor’s refresh rate. There is a new configuration option to
  control this `sync_to_monitor`.
* When displaying only a single window, use the default background color of the
  window (which can be changed via escape codes) as the color for the margin
  and padding of the window.
* Add some non standard terminfo capabilities used by neovim and tmux.
* Fix large drop in performance when using multiple top-level windows on macOS
* Fix save/restore of window sizes not working correctly.
* Remove option to use system wcwidth(). Now always use a wcwidth() based on
  the Unicode standard. Only sane way.
* Fix a regression that caused a few ligature glyphs to not render correctly in
  rare circumstances.
* Browsing the scrollback buffer now happens in an overlay window instead of a
  new window/tab.

### 0.6.0 [2017-12-18][¶](#id114 "Link to this heading")

* Support background transparency via the background\_opacity option. Provided
  that your OS/window manager supports transparency, you can now have kitty
  render pixels that have only the default background color as
  semi-transparent.
* Support multiple top level (OS) windows. These windows all share the sprite
  texture cache on the GPU, further reducing overall resource usage. Use
  the shortcut ctrl+shift+n to open a new top-level window.
* Add support for a *daemon* mode using the --single-instance command line
  option. With this option you can have only a single kitty instance running.
  All future invocations simply open new top-level windows in the existing
  instance.
* Support colored emoji
* Use CoreText instead of FreeType to render text on macOS
* Support running on the “low power” GPU on dual GPU macOS machines
* Add a new “grid” window layout
* Drop the dependency on glfw (kitty now uses a modified, bundled copy of glfw)
* Add an option to control the audio bell volume on X11 systems
* Add a command line switch to set the name part of the WM\_CLASS window
  property independently.
* Add a command line switch to set the window title.
* Add more options to customize the tab-bar’s appearance (font styles and
  separator)
* Allow drag and drop of files into kitty. On drop kitty will paste the
  file path to the running program.
* Add an option to control the underline style for URL highlighting on hover
* X11: Set the WINDOWID environment variable
* Fix middle and right buttons swapped when sending mouse events to child
  processes
* Allow selecting in a rectangle by holding down Ctrl+Alt while dragging with
  the mouse.

### 0.5.1 [2017-12-01][¶](#id115 "Link to this heading")

* Add an option to control the thickness of lines in box drawing characters
* Increase max. allowed ligature length to nine characters
* Fix text not vertically centered when adjusting line height
* Fix unicode block characters not being rendered properly
* Fix shift+up/down not generating correct escape codes
* Image display: Fix displaying images taller than two screen heights not
  scrolling properly

### 0.5.0 [2017-11-19][¶](#id116 "Link to this heading")

* Add support for ligature fonts such as Fira Code, Hasklig, etc. kitty now
  uses harfbuzz for text shaping which allow it to support advanced OpenType
  features such as contextual alternates/ligatures/combining glyphs/etc.
* Make it easy to select fonts by allowing listing of monospace fonts using:
  kitty list-fonts
* Add an option to have window focus follow mouse
* Add a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+shift+f11) to toggle fullscreen mode
* macOS: Fix handling of option key. It now behaves just like the alt key on
  Linux. There is an option to make it type unicode characters instead.
* Linux: Add support for startup notification on X11 desktops. kitty will
  now inform the window manager when its startup is complete.
* Fix shell prompt being duplicated when window is resized
* Fix crash when displaying more than 64 images in the same session
* Add support for colons in SGR color codes. These are generated by some
  applications such as neovim when they mistakenly identify kitty as a libvte
  based terminal.
* Fix mouse interaction not working in apps using obsolete mouse interaction
  protocols
* Linux: no longer require glew as a dependency

### 0.4.2 [2017-10-23][¶](#id117 "Link to this heading")

* Fix a regression in 0.4.0 that broke custom key mappings
* Fix a regression in 0.4.0 that broke support for non-QWERTY keyboard layouts
* Avoid using threads to reap zombie child processes. Also prevent kitty from
  hanging if the open program hangs when clicking on a URL.

### 0.4.0 [2017-10-22][¶](#id118 "Link to this heading")

* Support for drawing arbitrary raster graphics (images) in the terminal via a
  new graphics protocol. kitty can draw images with full 32-bit color using both
  ssh connections and files/shared memory (when available) for better
  performance. The drawing primitives support alpha blending and z-index.
  Images can be drawn both above and below text. See [Terminal graphics protocol](../graphics-protocol/).
  for details.
* Refactor kitty’s internals to make it even faster and more efficient. The CPU
  usage of kitty + X server while doing intensive tasks such as scrolling a
  file continuously in less has been reduced by 50%. There are now two
  configuration options `repaint_delay` and `input_delay` you can use to
  fine tune kitty’s performance vs CPU usage profile. The CPU usage of kitty +
  X when scrolling in less is now significantly better than most (all?) other
  terminals. See [Performance](../performance/).
* Hovering over URLs with the mouse now underlines them to indicate they
  can be clicked. Hold down Ctrl+Shift while clicking to open the URL.
* Selection using the mouse is now more intelligent. It does not add
  blank cells (i.e. cells that have no content) after the end of text in a
  line to the selection.
* The block cursor in now fully opaque but renders the character under it in
  the background color, for enhanced visibility.
* Allow combining multiple independent actions into a single shortcut
* Add a new shortcut to pass the current selection to an external program
* Allow creating shortcuts to open new windows running arbitrary commands. You
  can also pass the current selection to the command as an arguments and the
  contents of the screen + scrollback buffer as stdin to the command.

# Extend with kittens - kitty

# Extend with kittens[¶](#extend-with-kittens "Link to this heading")

*kitty* has a framework for easily creating terminal programs that make use of
its advanced features. These programs are called kittens. They are used both to
add features to *kitty* itself and to create useful standalone programs.
Some prominent kittens:

[icat](../kittens/icat/)
:   Display images in the terminal.

[diff](../kittens/diff/)
:   A fast, side-by-side diff for the terminal with syntax highlighting and
    images.

[Unicode input](../kittens/unicode_input/)
:   Easily input arbitrary Unicode characters in *kitty* by name or hex code.

[Themes](../kittens/themes/)
:   Preview and quick switch between over three hundred color themes.

[Fonts](../kittens/choose-fonts/)
:   Preview, fine-tune and quick switch the fonts used by kitty.

[Hints](../kittens/hints/)
:   Select and open/paste/insert arbitrary text snippets such as URLs,
    filenames, words, lines, etc. from the terminal screen.

[Quick access terminal](../kittens/quick-access-terminal/)
:   Get access to a quick access floating, semi-transparent kitty window
    with a single keypress.

[Panel](../kittens/panel/)
:   Draw the desktop wallpaper or docks and panels using arbitrary
    terminal programs.

[Remote file](../kittens/remote_file/)
:   Edit, open, or download remote files over SSH easily, by simply clicking on
    the filename.

[Transfer files](../kittens/transfer/)
:   Transfer files and directories seamlessly and easily from remote machines
    over your existing SSH sessions with a simple command.

[Hyperlinked grep](../kittens/hyperlinked_grep/)
:   Search your files using [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
    and open the results directly in your favorite editor in the terminal,
    at the line containing the search result, simply by clicking on the result
    you want.

[Broadcast](../kittens/broadcast/)
:   Type in one [kitty window](../glossary/#term-window) and have it broadcast to all (or a
    subset) of other [kitty windows](../glossary/#term-window).

[SSH](../kittens/ssh/)
:   SSH with automatic [shell integration](../shell-integration/#shell-integration), connection
    re-use for low latency and easy cloning of local shell and editor
    configuration to the remote host.

[Panel](../kittens/panel/)
:   Draw a GPU accelerated dock panel on your desktop showing the output from an
    arbitrary terminal program.

[Clipboard](../kittens/clipboard/)
:   Copy/paste to the clipboard from shell scripts, even over SSH.

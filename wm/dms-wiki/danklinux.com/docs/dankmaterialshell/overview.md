DankMaterialShell (dms) is a Wayland desktop shell built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/). It serves a purpose similar to GNOME Shell or KDE Plasma, providing a unified interface for launching applications, managing windows, managing hardware interfaces, notifications, and much more.

## General Features[​](#general-features "Direct link to General Features")

* Launcher (Apps, file search, web search, emoji search, calculations, and extendable with plugins)
* System Tray
* Notifications with grouping support
* Network Management (via NetworkManager, iwd, systemd-networkd, or some hybrid setups)
* VPN Management (via NetworkManager)
* Bluetooth Management (via BlueZ)
* Audio Management (via PipeWire)
* Idle & Power Management
* Brightness controls (Backlight, LEDs, and i2c/ddc)
* Lock Screen

* System sounds (such as notifications, volume changes, etc.)
* Mpris media controls with audio visualization
* Dozens of widgets and plugins available to allow virtually any feature you can imagine.

*There's really too much to list, but those are some of the highlights!*

## Architecture[​](#architecture "Direct link to Architecture")

DankMaterialShell uses a client-server architecture where a Go backend (`dms`) manages system integrations and spawns the Quickshell-based UI as a child process. Communication happens over Unix socket using REQ/REP and PUB/SUB patterns.

**Key Points:**

* **dms** spawns **Quickshell** as a child process
* **dms** and **Quickshell** both integrate with Wayland and D-Bus APIs independently
* **dms** fills gaps that Quickshell doesn't handle natively
* Communication between QML app and dms backend happens via Unix socket

### Component Overview[​](#component-overview "Direct link to Component Overview")

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **DankMaterialShell - Quickshell** | Frontend powering widgets, modals, and user experience. |
| **DankMaterialShell - Backend (cli)** | Bridges DBus, Wayland, and plugin APIs - also a management CLI |
| **dgop** | Optional system telemetry service used by resource widgets. |
| **dsearch** | Optional filesystem search engine used by the Spotlight launcher. |

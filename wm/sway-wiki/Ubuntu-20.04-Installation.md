## Sway on Ubuntu 20.04

**Note:** the guide is maintained by third party and not directly by the Sway project.

There is a third-party maintained guide that has as an objective making it as simple as possible to follow the steps to install Sway on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine from source.

This guide also tries to cover the "missing pieces" that you might not know you need when trying out Sway or that are not immediately clear, so that you can easily try and explore it, and if you feel like going back to Ubuntu you will be able to with a couple of clicks! 

Currently you will be installing sway 1.5.1, while hopefully we can go back to build the latest version soon!

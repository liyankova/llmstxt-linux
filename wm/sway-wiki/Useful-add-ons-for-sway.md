Here is a list of apps and scripts for Sway (and probably other Wayland compositors based on wlroots).

Note that pretty much all GTK and KDE apps such as firefox, thunderbird, chromium, even emacs (with the puregtk/emacs-28 branch) can be run as native wayland under sway so they're not listed here.

A collection of user-contributed scripts is available in [sway-contrib](https://github.com/OctopusET/sway-contrib).

An extensible `Guile` scheme bindings for sway with easy to configure modules to manage workspaces, nested keybindings, layouts, and events is available in [guile-swayer](https://github.com/ebeem/guile-swayer).

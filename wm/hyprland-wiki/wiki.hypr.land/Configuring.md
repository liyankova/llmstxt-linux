# Configuring – Hyprland Wiki

Configuring

# Configuring

This section is all about the configuring (aka ricing) of your Hyprland experience.
It links to other pages where necessary, and will walk you through:

* The config file
* Every option and function in it
* Extending functionality via scripts
* Some uncommon tips and tricks (e.g. switching layouts, disabling keybinds on-demand, etc)

It also contains some sample configurations you can take inspiration from.

Start with [the Start Page](./Start).
